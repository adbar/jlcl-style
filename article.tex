\section*{Abstract}
This article describes the Arabic alphabet.



\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Alphabet}

%The Arabic alphabet has 29 letters including the Hamza (\textRL{ء}), consonants and three long vowels (\textAR{ا، و، ي}).
%The short vowels or vowel signs are not part of alphabet but they are merely oral.
%Along with the three short vowels (\textRL{ـَ ـُ ـِ}), the Arabic script has other phonetic symbols, together known as diacritic marks.
%Diacritics are sound symbols represented as strokes that are placed above or below the letter.
